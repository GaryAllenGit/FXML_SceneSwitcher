Java fxml demo to show how to change the scene on the primary stage and how to create pop-up Stages.

Dr Gary Allen, The University of Huddersfield.

This project was created in IntelliJ using Scene Builder to create the user interfaces.  The main class loads a very simple GUI.  Clicking the buttons either changes the Scene on the "primaryStage", or creates a pop-up window in a new Stage.
